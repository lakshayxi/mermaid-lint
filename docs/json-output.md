# JSON output schema

`mermaid-lint --format json` (or `format: 'json'` in the config) emits a
machine-readable report on stdout. Use it to wire mermaid-lint into CI scripts,
dashboards, or other tooling.

```bash
npx mermaid-lint --format json --all
```

## Schema

```json
{
  "version": "0.52.1",
  "files": [
    {
      "path": "docs/api.md",
      "diagrams": [
        { "line": 42, "col": 1, "type": "flowchart", "ok": true,
          "warnings": [{ "rule": "duplicate-ids", "message": "node \"A\" declared with label \"Start\" (line 44) and \"Begin\" (line 49)", "line": 49, "severity": "error" }] },
        { "line": 89, "col": 1, "type": "sequenceDiagram", "ok": false,
          "error": { "message": "sequence message is missing a colon", "line": 91, "col": 5,
                     "raw": "Expecting 'TXT', got 'NEWLINE'", "suggestion": "Alice->>Bob: hello", "fixable": true },
          "warnings": [] }
      ]
    }
  ],

## Fields

- **`version`** — the mermaid-lint version that produced the report.
- **`files[]`** — one entry per file that contained at least one Mermaid block.
  - **`path`** — the file path.
  - **`diagrams[]`** — one entry per Mermaid block in the file.
    - **`line` / `col`** — 1-indexed position of the fence opener in the file.
    - **`type`** — detected diagram type (e.g. `flowchart`, `sequenceDiagram`).
    - **`ok`** — `true` if the diagram parses.
    - **`error`** — present when `ok` is `false`: `{ message, line, col }` with the
      precise location of the syntax error, plus three optional fields:
      - **`message`** — human-readable and, for a parser failure, *translated*:
        it names the defect (see [error-messages.md](error-messages.md)) rather
        than echoing mermaid's grammar-level wording, and cites no line of its
        own — the position is already carried structurally in `line`/`col`.
      - **`raw`** — mermaid's own original message, present only for parser
        failures (structural defects like an unclosed fence never reach a
        parser and carry none). Any line number mermaid cites inside it is
        mapped into file coordinates exactly like every other `line` in this
        report — see the callout below.
      - **`suggestion`** — the one corrected version of the offending source
        line the translation is confident about, when it is confident about
        one. This is quoted source, not prose, so unlike `raw` it is never
        line-mapped: rewriting a number inside it could corrupt a number the
        author actually typed.
      - **`fixable`** — `true` when `--fix` would write `suggestion` verbatim.
    - **`warnings[]`** — semantic findings: `{ rule, message, line, severity }`. See
      [semantic-rules.md](semantic-rules.md) for the rule list and how to tune
      severity.
- **`summary`** — totals across all files, plus a `types` histogram.

Every `line` in this report — the diagram's, an `error`'s, a warning's, and any
line number quoted inside a `message` — is a line in the **file**, not an offset
within the diagram body. So they are directly comparable: a warning at `line`
49 sits 7 lines below a diagram whose fence opens at 42. (Core's `checkSemantics`
API is the exception: it returns body-relative lines, which the CLI maps before
they reach this report.) `error.raw`, when present, follows the same rule as
everything else here: any line number mermaid cited inside its own message text
is mapped body→file the same way `message` used to be, so it is file-relative
too — not an offset into the diagram body. `error.suggestion` is the one field
that is deliberately exempt: it quotes the author's source line verbatim, and
running the same mapping over it would risk rewriting a number the author
actually typed.

## Example: fail CI on errors (any language)

```bash
npx mermaid-lint --format json --all | python -c "
import sys, json
out = json.load(sys.stdin)
if out['summary']['errors']:
    for f in out['files']:
        for d in f['diagrams']:
            if not d['ok']:
                print(f\"{f['path']}:{d['line']}: {d['error']['message']}\")
    sys.exit(1)
"
```
